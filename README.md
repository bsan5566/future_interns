🎯 Thrilled to share my learning journey at FutureInterns! 🚀

As a Data Analytics Intern, I had the opportunity to work on real-world datasets, gaining hands-on experience with tools like Power BI to transform complex data into actionable insights.

📊 One of my key projects involved building an interactive dashboard (TASK12), where I explored trends, visualized KPIs, and derived meaningful conclusions from raw data.

🔍 What I learned:

Data storytelling through dashboards

Importance of clean, structured data

Turning numbers into business value

I'm grateful to FutureInterns for this incredible opportunity and mentorship! Excited to continue growing in the field of data analytics. 💼✨
